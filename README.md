GDModdingTool is a tool for modding Grim Dawn with two main goals:
* Make modding, changing thousands of game files, easy and fast
* Make it affected less, preferably none at all, by game updates (Whenever game gets an update, just re-running tool should be enough)

Check [Wiki](https://github.com/azakhi/GDModdingTool/wiki) for installation and other information.

### Issues & Questions
You can create issues [here](https://github.com/azakhi/GDModdingTool/issues) in Github for your problems and questions. Also you can post those in Grim Dawn forums [here](https://forums.crateentertainment.com/t/tool-gdmoddingtool-tool-for-making-personal-customized-mods/50983).

If you have troubles using tool, providing following files/answers would help me solve the problem:
* Did you use ExtractFiles.bat file to extract files? If so, are you sure you gave correct paths?
* `config.txt` file you used.
* Output of program. If it closes immediately, try to run it from command window by; 1) Type `cmd` in Windows Search and Right Click > Run as Administrator 2) Run tool from command window with
```
path\to\tool\GDModdingTool.exe
```
* Log files created by the program. Those are located in the same folder and named as Logs_DATE_TIME.txt like `Logs_27.05.19_21.44.19.txt`
